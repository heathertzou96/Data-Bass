    "We looked at NBA data, specifically focusing on players who got player of the week from 1985-86 to 2017-18 season and seeing their stats. We got players stats & salaries info from data.world and player of the week info from Kaggle. Initially, we wanted to look at all of the stats for players who got player of the week in one comprehensive table but ran into issues regarding duplicates so we decided to focus on two fields (salaries & draft year) for simplicity’s sake for this project.
